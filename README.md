## ðŸ§  Credit Default Prediction API (Classical ML - XGBoost + Flask)

This project showcases a complete end-to-end classical machine learning pipeline that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default, using the **German Credit dataset**. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, pipeline export, and deployment via a RESTful Flask API. The deployed model is accessible publicly through a secured endpoint.

### Dataset: German Credit Data

The dataset includes customer financial attributes with the goal of predicting credit default risk.

- **Size**: 1,000 records
- **Features**: 20 features including:
  - `age`
  - `credit_history`
  - `purpose`
  - `employment_duration`
  - `savings`
  - `housing`
- **Target Variable**: `credit_risk`
  - `0`: Will pay back
  - `1`: Likely to default

### Model Pipeline Design

#### 1. Preprocessing

- **Categorical Features**: Transformed via `OneHotEncoder`
- **Numerical Features**: Passed directly
- **Pipeline**: Used `ColumnTransformer` to unify preprocessing and `Pipeline` to chain preprocessing + model

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
```

#### 2. Handling Class Imbalance

- Found \~70:30 imbalance in class distribution
- Used `scale_pos_weight` in XGBoost to counteract bias toward majority class

```python
model = XGBClassifier(scale_pos_weight=2.2)
```

#### 3. Training & Evaluation

- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion matrix
  - Cross-validation
- Used stratified split for balanced testing

---

### Exporting the Model

The pipeline (preprocessing + XGBoost model) was exported as a `.pkl` file:

```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(pipeline, "credit_default_pipeline.pkl")
```

This allows for reusability and deployment without retraining.

### Running the Flask API

#### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install flask pandas joblib scikit-learn xgboost
```

#### Step 2: Run the server

```bash
python app.py
```

    "duration": 60,
    ...
  },
  {
    "status": "critical_account",
    "duration": 24,
    ...
  }
]
```

#### Sample response

```json
[
  {
    "confidence": "83.44%",
    "outcome": "Likely to default (not pay back)"
  },
  {
    "confidence": "67.29%",
    "outcome": "Likely to pay back"
  }
]
```
